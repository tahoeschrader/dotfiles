# dotfiles
A place to store all my home and system configurations.

## Attributes
Heavily borrowing ideas/formatting from the following:
- https://github.com/nmasur/dotfiles
- https://github.com/schradert/dotfiles

## TODO
- SSH
- GIT
- Do I need to worry about secrets
- Figure out how many simlinks and `.blah` folders can be moved to a central location other than my home folder
- Figure out how to get nix to ensure cargo installs `tpi` and `trunk` globally
- Move more applications to nix versions (discord, brave, brave extensions, etc.)
- Make configurations for my other clients (thinkcentre, rasperry pi, etc.)
